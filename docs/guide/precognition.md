# Precognition

## Overview

Precognition is a new Laravel feature [introduced recently](https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/44339) but not yet published. 

It allows developers to create improved experiences for their users by introducing the concept of a precognitive request. An example of said improved experience is real-time validation.

## On the roadmap

We plan on supporting it , notably by introducing first-party support for real-time validation, among other features if possible.
