# Global properties

## Sharing data

Sharing data means making it available globally, throughout the application. This is usually done to expose commonly-needed information, such as the logged-in user.

Shared data can then be accessed in the front-end using `useProperty` or `useProperties`.

## From the middleware

The most common way of sharing data is to defining it in the `HandleHybridlyRequests` middleware. It has a `share` method specifically for this purpose.

```php
public function share(): SharedData
{
    return SharedData::from([
        'security' => [
            'user' => UserData::optional(auth()->user()),
        ],
    ]);
}
```

Though this method can return any serializable property, such as a `Collection`, an array, a `Resource`, or anything `Arrayable`, a data object class is preferred in order to benefit from automatically-generated TypeScript definition.

In the example above, `SharedData` is a simple data object that accepts a `SecurityData`, which accepts a `UserData`.

```php
// App\Data\SharedData
final class SharedData extends Data
{
    public function __construct(
        public readonly SecurityData $security,
    ) {
    }
}

// App\Data\SecurityData
final class SecurityData extends Data
{
    public function __construct(
        public readonly ?UserData $user,
        public readonly int $characters,
    ) {
    }
}

// App\Data\UserData
final class UserData extends Data
{
    public function __construct(
        public readonly ?int $id,
        public readonly string $username,
        public readonly string $display_name,
        public readonly ?string $profile_picture_url,
        public readonly ?Carbon $identity_verified_at,
        public readonly string $email,
    ) {
    }
}
```

## From anywhere

In the eventual case where sharing data outside the middleware is needed, it is possible through the `hybridly` function.

```php
hybridly()->share([
    'foo' => 'bar'
]);
```

While this is a useful escape hatch, it is not recommended. This way of sharing data being dynamic by nature, it is not possible to completely type it. 

If possible, consider using the middleware instead.

## TypeScript support

As previously stated, global data can be fully typed. Unfortunately, this process is not entirely automatic - you still need to create a TypeScript definition file. Fortunately, you won't have to manually update it - it's a one-time setup.

```ts
interface GlobalHybridlyProperties extends App.Data.SharedData {
}
```

The `GlobalHybridlyProperties` interface is used by the Vue adapter to provide definitions for globally-shared data. 

Overriding this interface by making it extend the generated data object is what provides auto-completion support to `useProperty` and related functionalities.

## Accessing global properties

The `useProperty` function provides typed dot-notation support for accessing global properties.

For instance, using the `user` property in the `security` array as shown in the earlier example would look like that:

```ts
const user = useProperty('security.user')
```

`useProperty` returns a `ref` that will be updated if the data is changed.
