# Upgrade guide

This guide describes how to upgrade from `v0.5.x` to `v0.6.x`.

## Updating to ESM syntax

- **Likelihood of impact**: <span class="text-yellow-700 dark:text-yellow-300">medium</span>

Vite is [deprecating its CommonJS API](https://vitejs.dev/guide/troubleshooting.html#vite-cjs-node-api-deprecated), which means projects should migrate to EcmaScript Modules.

For projects already using ESM syntax, this is simply a matter of adding `"type": "module"` to `package.json`. For other projects, you will have to update the syntax in order to upgrade to `v0.6.x`. 

## Updating `vite.config.ts`

- **Likelihood of impact**: <span class="text-green-700 dark:text-green-300">low</span>

Hybridly now embeds its own plugin to integrate with Laravel instead of relying on [`laravel/vite-plugin`](https://github.com/laravel/vite-plugin). This allows us to have more control over functionalities and updates.

You may remove the `laravel` property from the plugin if you were using it:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import hybridly from 'hybridly/vite'

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [
		hybridly({
			laravel: { // [!code --]
				valetTls: true,  // [!code --]
			}, // [!code --]
		}),
	],
})
```

If you were specifying a custom `input` value through the `laravel` property, you may do so via `build.rollupOptions.input` instead.
