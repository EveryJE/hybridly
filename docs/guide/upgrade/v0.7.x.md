# Upgrade guide

<div class="preface">
This guide describes how to upgrade from <code>v0.6.x</code> to <code>v0.7.x</code>.

## Updating calls to `defineLayout` and `defineLayoutProperties` <impact-header impact="high" />

The `defineLayout` and `defineLayoutProperties` utils were removed. Instead, you may use `defineOptions`, a macro provided by Vue 3.3+.

**Before**:
```ts
defineLayout(main)
defineLayoutProperties({
	fullscreen: false,
})
```

**After**:
```ts
defineOptions({
	layout: main,
	properties: {
		fullscreen: false,
	},
})
```

## Update the `recursive` arguments of `loadModuleFrom` <impact-header impact="low" />

The `recursive` argument of the `loadModuleFrom`, `loadModulesFrom` and `loadModule` methods has been renamed to `deep` to better reflect what it does. If you were using named parameters, you will have to update your code accordingly.
