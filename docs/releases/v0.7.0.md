## Upgrading

You may upgrade Hybridly using the following commands:

```shell [pnpm]
composer require "hybridly/laravel:^0.7.0"
pnpm i -D hybridly@^0.7.0
```

This release contains breaking change. Please follow the [upgrade guide](../guide/upgrade/v0.6.x.md).

## `defineLayout` and `defineLayoutProperties` are gone

Previously, you had the ability to define a page's layout and its properties through the `defineLayout` and `defineLayoutProperties` utils.

These functions were implemented prior to [`defineOptions`](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#defineoptions) being added to Vue.

Even though they were useful, there was multiple issues with them:
- They caused a recursive page refresh in some situations, resulting in a lag after HMR,
- They were incompatible with server-side rendering,
- Their implementation was somewhat complex to maintain due to reactivity hoops.

You may now use `defineOptions`:

```ts
defineOptions({
	layout: main,
	properties: {
		fullscreen: false,
	},
})
```

## `useBackForward` now accepts options

[`useBackForward`](../api/utils/use-back-forward.md) is an util function that registers callbacks executed during back-forward browser navigations.

It now accepts a parameter that defines whether the page component should be reloaded on back-forward navigations:

```ts
useBackForward({
	reload: true,
})
```

This is the equivalent of calling the returned `reloadOnBackForward` function. It's simply more practical.
