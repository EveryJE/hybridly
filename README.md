# Q&A

**What's the goal of this project?**
> Hybridly aims to provide the best possible developer experience when using Laravel, Vue and Vite. While its philosophy is not to stay as minimalist as Inertia, in order to keep up with the DX needs, it is not going to be bloated with too many features either.

&nbsp;

**Will Hybridly be properly maintained?**
> I'm primarily building Hybridly for myself. I am actively using and improving it. That means Hybridly is an opinionated project and may not suite your tastes, but it will live as long as I am a developer and I didn't find a better way to build web applications.

&nbsp;

**When should I use Hybridly instead of Inertia?**
> Inertia is sponsored by Laravel and has better support throughout the community. You should keep using it if you're afraid of not being able to get support and if you don't mind its philosophy and the few issues it has.

&nbsp;

**Why fork Inertia instead of contributing?**
> I tried, but my philosophy doesn't always match Inertia's. Additionally, the maintenance of Inertia is lacking, pull requests and issues are not being addressed.

&nbsp;

**Can I use Hybridly with other frameworks than Laravel or Vue?**
> The core of Hybridly is framework-agnostic, just like Inertia's. But there is no plan for an official adapter other than Laravel and Vue, because that is what I am using and willing to maintain. Feel free to create your own adapter though.
